# 6. The API Design Process

A rigorous design process ensures the API meets business, user, and technical requirements before a single line of implementation code is written.

## 6.1 Critical Steps in the Design Process

|Step|Objective|Engineering Focus|
|---|---|---|
|**1. Identify Core Use Cases & User Stories**|Determine _what_ clients will actually need to do with the API.|Define the API's fundamental utility. Map user workflows (e.g., "A user needs to sign up and then retrieve their orders") to specific endpoints and operations.|
|**2. Define Scope and Boundaries**|Clearly delineate which services, resources, and data the API will expose.|Enforce the **Abstraction Mechanism** principle. Define the stable contract and what functionality is intentionally hidden or excluded.|
|**3. Determine Performance Requirements**|Establish clear **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** for latency, throughput, and error rates.|Design for scale and efficiency. This step drives decisions on caching strategies, pagination models, and protocol choice (e.g., REST vs. gRPC).|
|**4. Consider Security Constraints**|Analyze authentication, authorization, and data privacy needs from the start.|Security by design. Ensure necessary security controls like rate limiting, OAuth flows, and input validation are integrated into the initial API specification.|

## 6.2 Key Design Approaches

The approach taken to begin the design phase heavily influences the resulting quality and flexibility of the API.

|Approach|Starting Point|Advantage|Ideal Scenario|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Top-Down**|High-level requirements, workflows, and user interfaces (UIs).|Client-centric and highly intuitive; the API perfectly fits the user's needs.|New projects or when developing an API specifically for a known set of clients (e.g., a new mobile app).|
|**Bottom-Up**|Existing data models, backend capabilities, and legacy systems.|Faster initial implementation; leverages existing system strengths.|Exposing an internal system as a public API or rapid prototyping where data structures are already rigid.|
|**Contract-First**|The API **contract** (specification document, e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger or Protobuf definition).|Forces clarity, consistency, and early feedback. Decouples client and server development (they can work in parallel). **The gold standard for professional API development.**|Most large-scale, robust, and well-governed API programs.|
