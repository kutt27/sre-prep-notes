# 8. HTTP Fundamentals and HTTPS Security

## 8.1 HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

HTTP is the primary protocol used for RESTful APIs and the transport mechanism for GraphQL. It is a stateless, request-response protocol.

### 8.1.1 The Communication Flow

- **HTTP Request (Client → Server):** Includes the HTTP Method, the path to the resource, and various Headers (e.g., `Authorization`).
    
- **HTTP Response (Server → Client):** Includes the Status Code, Response Headers (e.g., `Content-Type`, `Cache-Control`), and the Response Body (Payload).
    

### 8.1.2 Core HTTP Components

|Component|Description|Relevance to API Design|
|---|---|---|
|**HTTP Methods (Verbs)**|Define the desired action to be performed on the resource.|Essential for **RESTful Design**. They map CRUD operations to clear actions.|
|**Status Codes**|Three-digit codes indicating the outcome of the request.|Crucial for client error handling and overall API clarity.|
|**Common Headers**|Metadata about the request or response.|Used for security (`Authorization`), format definition (`Content-Type`, `Accept`), and performance (`Cache-Control`).|

### 8.1.3 Standard HTTP Methods

|Method|Action (CRUD)|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|**GET**|Retrieve (Read)|Fetches a representation of the resource. Must be idempotent and safe.|
|**POST**|Create|Submits data to the specified resource, often resulting in a new resource. Not idempotent.|
|**PUT**|Update (Full)|Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content. Idempotent.|
|**DELETE**|Remove (Delete)|Removes the specified resource. Idempotent.|
|**PATCH**|Update (Partial)|Applies partial modifications to a resource. Not inherently idempotent.|

## 8.2 HTTPS (HTTP Secure)

HTTPS is **HTTP + TLS/SSL Encryption**. It is the absolute minimum requirement for any production API.

### 8.2.1 Core Security Function

HTTPS protects data in transit from eavesdropping, interference, and forgery by encrypting the entire communication channel.

### 8.2.2 Benefits of Using HTTPS

|Benefit|Description|
|---|---|
|**Data Encryption**|Converts transmitted data into an unreadable format, ensuring confidentiality.|
|**Data Integrity**|Cryptographic checks ensure data has not been tampered with during transmission.|
|**Authentication**|Verifies the identity of the server (using its certificate), preventing connections to malicious entities.|
|**SEO Benefits**|Search engines (like Google) favor and prioritize secure (HTTPS) websites and APIs.|

### 8.2.3 Risks Without HTTPS

|Risk Category|Description|
|---|---|
|**Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**|An attacker intercepts and relays messages between the client and server without their knowledge.|
|**Data Tampering**|An attacker can modify data sent between the client and server (e.g., changing an order total).|
|**Information Theft**|Sensitive data (passwords, tokens, personal information) is transmitted in clear text.|
|**Loss of User Trust**|Publicly known security failures severely damage reputation.|
